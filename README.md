## üîß Configuration

### Default Settings

```csharp
// Download Settings
SegmentsCount = 8              // Parallel connections per download
BufferSize = 32768             // 32KB buffer per segment
MaxRetries = 5                 // Maximum retry attempts
ConnectionTimeout = 30s        // HTTP connection timeout
ReadTimeout = 30min            // HTTP read timeout

// Server Settings
ServerPort = 4153              // Browser integration port
ServerHost = "localhost"       // Local-only access

// Connection Pooling
MaxConnectionsPerServer = 32   // HTTP connection pool size
PooledConnectionLifetime = 15m // Connection reuse timeout
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Download Stuck at 0%
**Symptoms**: Progress bar doesn't move, speed shows 0
**Causes**: Server doesn't support Range requests or network issues
**Solutions**:
- Verify the URL is accessible in a browser
- Check your internet connection
- Try a different download source
- The app will automatically fall back to single-threaded download

#### 2. Browser Integration Not Working
**Symptoms**: Bookmarklet doesn't add downloads
**Causes**: Port 4153 blocked or in use
**Solutions**:
- Check Windows Firewall settings
- Ensure no other app is using port 4153
- Restart MyFastDownloader
- Try running as administrator

#### 3. High Memory Usage
**Symptoms**: Application uses excessive RAM
**Causes**: Multiple large downloads or insufficient cleanup
**Solutions**:
- Limit concurrent downloads
- Restart the application periodically
- Increase available system RAM
- Close other memory-intensive applications

#### 4. Slow Download Speeds
**Symptoms**: Downloads slower than expected
**Causes**: Server limitations, network congestion, or interference
**Solutions**:
- Try downloading during off-peak hours
- Temporarily disable antivirus real-time scanning
- Use wired connection instead of WiFi
- Check if other apps are using bandwidth

### Debug Mode

To enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:
1. Run from command line: `MyFastDownloader.exe --debug`
2. Check console output for detailed information
3. Logs include HTTP requests, segment progress, and errors

### Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Use SSD Storage**: Significantly faster write speeds
2. **Wired Connection**: More stable than WiFi
3. **Disable Antivirus Scanning**: For download folder temporarily
4. **Close Unnecessary Apps**: Free up system resources
5. **Optimal Segment Count**: 8-16 segments works best for most files
